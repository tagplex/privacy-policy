No Server-Side Storage: We do not operate any external servers to store user data, preferences, or usage history.

Responsibility: All content (playlists, URLs, EPG data) loaded into the Application is the sole responsibility of the user.

Local Processing: Any playlist URL or link entered by the user is processed and stored locally on the Samsung Smart TV device memory only for the purpose of functioning. This information is never uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.

No Content Provided: IPTV PLAYER does not provide, host, or sell any media content or IPTV subscriptions.
